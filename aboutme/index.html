    <h2>Gehrig Sproul</h2>
    <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Gehrig Sproul! I am from Utah. I am currently studying to get a Bachelors Degree in Business and eventually own my own business. I am studying at BYUI and am having a blast at this school. I am currently unemployed from a job but am currently looking for one. </p>
    <p>I am taking the web development class so that I can learn if this is something I would also like to pursue, or if it is a hobby that I would not mind doing in my spare time. I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was a kid and recently got back from a mission in Italy, Rome.</p>
